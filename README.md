# Numix Square
Square is an icon theme for Linux from the [Numix project](http://numixproject.org). This readme provides information on [installation](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-square/#installation), [icon requests](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-square/#icon-requests) and [hardcoded icons](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-square/#hardcoded-icons). Licensed under the GPL-3.0+

### Installation
If using this with our [base icon theme](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme) make sure you install both parts using the same method. Information on how to install Square will be added as we sort out our distribution specific packages.

### Issues & Requests
The tracker for this repo is only for issues relating to the Linux packaging. Please report icon requests in [this repo](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-core/issues) which handles the icons themselves.
For normal applications follow [this video tutorial](https://plus.google.com/+NumixprojectOrg/posts/DkRmhFZuWez), for Steam games follow [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuUy4CzCoXc) and for Chrome apps just post a link to the webstore page. When filing your request please be respectful, patient, and remember that Square development is done solely on the back of donations.

### Hardcoded Icons
To deal with hardcoded application icons Numix uses the [hardcode-fixer](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer) script. A list of the applications supported by the script can be found [here](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer/wiki/App-Support).
